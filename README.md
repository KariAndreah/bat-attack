## Application Description 

Bat Attack is an responsive interactive app that shows 3 MLB batter's performance over time. The application calls data from a TruMedia api. Users can choose between the 3 batters and show their total 2018 season stats (AB, H, HR, RBI, AVG, OPB, SLG, OPS), as well as batting average and on-base-percentage plus slugging over a 2018 line graph. 

### Known Issues

In order to load the batter images on Google Chrome, you need to allow insecure content. The MLB api, where the batter image is called, is insecure.
